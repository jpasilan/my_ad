                                writing at that party\'s principal place of business, attention of that party\'s principal legal officer, or at such
                                other address or by such other method as the party shall specify in writing. Notice shall be deemed given upon
                                personal delivery or facsimile, or, if sent by certified mail with postage prepaid, 5 business days after the date
                                of mailing, or, if sent by international overnight courier with postage prepaid, 7 business days after the date of
                                mailing. If any provision herein is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force
                                without being affected in any way. Further, the parties agree to replace such unenforceable provision with an
                                enforceable provision that most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the unenforceable provision.
